## A overview of Tabbre

***Cheap, plentiful, reliable renewable energy is essential for a sustainable, prosperous future. The Tabbre Project's floating solar farm technologies, coupled with Tabbre’s unique tokenomic model, will provide the world with cheap and abundant renewable energy.***

### The problem

Net Zero policies are making access to energy unreliable and expensive. This is a disaster for the world's poor. This because today's renewable energy is very expensive when compared to coal, oil and gas.

The reason that renewable energy is expensive is the enormous and hence very expensive scale of infrastructure that is needed to capture enough sunlight and wind energy to cope with intermittency and seasonality.

### The Solution

The only viable way to achieve net zero is to make renewable energy cheaper and more abundant than fossil fuels.

Tabbre will achieve this by creating vast oceanic photovoltaic solar farms. These will use flexible lightweight floating structures made from recyclable plastic. They will be located in the oceanic gyres of the South Atlantic, South Pacific and South Indian Ocean.

These oceanic gyres are deserted, largely sterile, tropical international waters covering tens of millions of square kilometres.

The electricity generated will be used to electrolyse water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be converted to methane or ammonia.

The hydrogen, methane and ammonia gases will be compressed or liquefied for shipping to consumers as a clean chemical fuel replacement for fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil. Using solar energy to produce hydrogen, methane and ammonia solves the problem of intermittency since these fuels, unlike electricity, can be easily transported and stored for later consumption.

**Tabbre's sustainable energy will be much less expensive and more plentiful than fossil fuels, and so market forces will drive the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy.**

Also because Tabbre's sustainable renewable energy can be delivered as hydrocarbon fuel, existing gas, oil and coal burning industrial, commercial and transport equipment can continue to be used.

This will make the transition to sustainable energy easier, cheaper and faster.

### The role of TABB and BRE

 To make this vision possible, Tabbre is creating two new cryptocurrency assets: TABB and BRE.

These will be expressed on a new blockchain, the TabbreChain. The TabbreChain uses a proof of stake consensus.

Transaction charges and other usage fees are payable in BRE. TABB is used as collateral for the stakes used in the TabbreChain's proof of stake consensus protocol. Stakeholders are rewarded in BRE.

The TabbreChain will provide a smart contract execution environment. The TabbreChain hosts the smart contracts that encode the decentralized foundation's governance and tokenocracy rules.

The governance smart contracts are amendable using a proof of stake voting system. This allows the Tabbre system to grow and evolve over time to reflect society's changing needs.

TABB is like Bitcoin in that it has a fixed maximum supply.

A large fraction of all TABB will be held by a decentralized foundation, The Tabbre Foundation. The Foundation's TABB holdings will be used as collateral for debt finance to fund the development of Tabbre's oceanic floating solar farms.

BRE will be issued and managed by the The Tabbre Foundation using an algorithmic method to ensure the value of BRE remains stable.

The renewable energy generated by Tabbre will be priced and sold for BRE. 

**BRE will be backed by the value of energy generated by the Tabbre scheme.**

### Distribution

As Tabbre develops, all profits generated by the scheme will be reinvested into more renewable energy capacity until a target energy output is reached.

At this point, called the distribution point, profits will be distributed.

The Tabbre decentralized foundation will distribute profits to TABB holders by using the profits to buy and burn TABB.

The intent is to cause significant appreciation in the value of TABB.

BRE is created dynamically on the Tabbre blockchain, in accordance with the Tabbre system's governance rules.

Tabbre is expected to be hugely profitable when it achieves its objective of being the principal global supplier of energy.

### The Global UBI

Tabbre's solar farms are located in international waters that are considered global commons.

In the interests of social fairness and social cohesion and as a protection against confiscation by avaricious and corrupt governments, Tabbre intends to use a significant fraction of profits from the scheme to fund a global universal basic income (UBI).

This will be distributed in BRE.

BRE's role in paying the global UBI coupled with BRE's role as the currency for trading energy will allow BRE to become a non national self-sovereign decentralized global reserve currency.

The Tabbre Project will help transition the world from fossil fuels and establish a global decentralized financial system and in so doing will help end both the climate crisis and global poverty.

### Global Decentralized Financial System


BRE is both the currency for the pricing and sale of energy generated by the Tabbre scheme and the currency for distributing Tabbre'e global UBI.

This will create a substantial and sustainable global economic role for BRE allowing it to become an international decentralized currency to rival fiat currencies.
As such BRE will need to be created in sufficient quantities that it operates as a stable value coin. It is envisaged the value of BRE will be governed by the average price of energy produced by the scheme.

Tabbre's dual coin scheme will be a censor resistant global monetary system that will supplement and compete with the world's existing fiat based banking systems.

### BRE Issuance
BRE will be a stable value coin in that its value will be linked to the value of energy produced by the Tabbre Project.

BRE will be issued by the BRE Monetary Authority, BMA. This will be a decentralized autonomous organization and will manage the supply of BRE using an algorithmic process informed by data provided by oracle services.

The BMA will be hosted on the TabbreChain. This blockchain will be secured using a proof of stake (PoS) consensus model. 

The TabbreChain will be operated by a consortium. Consortium members will be eligible to operate a validator node on the TabbreChain blockchain.
This will require the member to provide a minimum amount of TABB to be held by the scheme as a stake. This stake will be subject to slashing if the validator node transgresses e.g. by accepting and processing invalid transactions.
A detailed description of the organization and operation of the TabbreChain is provided elsewhere.

Transaction charges will be applied to transactions submitted to the TabbreChain. These transaction charges will be denominated and payable in the BRE. BRE will be the TabbreChain’s native transactional currency.

New  BRE coins will be minted onto the TabbreChain by the BMA. These newly minted BRE may be lent by the BMA to entities called collateralized credit agents, CCAs.

CCA’s will provide TABB as collateral to the BMA as a pre-requisite for borrowing BRE.
In the event of a CCA not repaying a BRE loan to the BMA, or failing to comply with the loan agreement in some other way,  the BMA will take the TABB collateral as full and final payment of the loan.Depending on the circumstances,TABB acquired in this way will either be vested, auctioned off or burnt. Whichever is most appropriate for ensuring stability of the TABB/BRE financial system.


The rate of interest charged by the BMA will act as the BRE economies base rate of interest, the BRE Base Rate (BBR).

The CCA’s will lend their borrowed BRE to retail customers including, inter alia: businesses, NGOs, consumers, state owned entities and local authorities. The interest rate charged by CCAs on their lending to the retail customers will be higher than the BBR. This provides the income for the CCAs. This could be considerable.
### BRE and Energy


Tabbre intends to sell the energy that it produces for BRE. In the early stages of the Tabbre scheme, this may be problematic for the commercial entities that will be buying the energy. They may have an aversion, either because of regulation or cultural inertia to use BRE on the basis that it is not a recognized fiat currency. To overcome this problem the Tabbre scheme will create intermediaries, Energy Sales Agents (Agents). These Agents
