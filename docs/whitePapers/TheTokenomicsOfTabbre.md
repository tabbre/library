## A overview of Tabbre

***Cheap, plentiful, reliable renewable energy is essential for a sustainable, prosperous future. The Tabbre Project's floating solar farm technologies, coupled with Tabbreâ€™s unique tokenomic model, will provide the world with cheap and abundant renewable energy.***

### The problem

Net Zero policies are making access to energy unreliable and expensive. This is a disaster for the world's poor. This because today's renewable energy is very expensive when compared to coal, oil and gas.

The reason that renewable energy is expensive is the enormous and hence very expensive scale of infrastructure that is needed to capture enough sunlight and wind energy to cope with intermittency and seasonality.

### The Solution

The only viable way to achieve net zero is to make renewable energy cheaper and more abundant than fossil fuels.

Tabbre will achieve this by creating vast oceanic photovoltaic solar farms. These will use flexible lightweight floating structures made from recyclable plastic. They will be located in the oceanic gyres of the South Atlantic, South Pacific and South Indian Ocean.

These oceanic gyres are deserted, largely sterile, tropical international waters covering tens of millions of square kilometres.

The electricity generated will be used to electrolyse water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be converted to methane or ammonia.

The hydrogen, methane and ammonia gases will be compressed or liquefied for shipping to consumers as a clean chemical fuel replacement for fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil. Using solar energy to produce hydrogen, methane and ammonia solves the problem of intermittency since these fuels, unlike electricity, can be easily transported and stored for later consumption.

**Tabbre's sustainable energy will be much less expensive and more plentiful than fossil fuels, and so market forces will drive the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy.**

Also because Tabbre's sustainable renewable energy can be delivered as hydrocarbon fuel, existing gas, oil and coal burning industrial, commercial and transport equipment can continue to be used.

This will make the transition to sustainable energy easier, cheaper and faster.

### The role of TABB and BRE

 To make this vision possible, Tabbre is creating two new cryptocurrency assets: TABB and BRE.

These will be expressed on a new blockchain, the TabbreChain. The TabbreChain uses a proof of stake consensus.

Transaction charges and other usage fees are payable in BRE. TABB is used as collateral for the stakes used in the TabbreChain's proof of stake consensus protocol. Stakeholders are rewarded in BRE.

The TabbreChain will provide a smart contract execution environment. The TabbreChain hosts the smart contracts that encode the decentralized foundation's governance and tokenocracy rules.

The governance smart contracts are amendable using a proof of stake voting system. This allows the Tabbre system to grow and evolve over time to reflect society's changing needs.

TABB is like Bitcoin in that it has a fixed maximum supply.

A large fraction of all TABB will be held by a decentralized foundation, The Tabbre Foundation. The Foundation's TABB holdings will be used as collateral for debt finance to fund the development of Tabbre's oceanic floating solar farms.

BRE will be issued and managed by the The Tabbre Foundation using an algorithmic method to ensure the value of BRE remains stable.

The renewable energy generated by Tabbre will be priced and sold for BRE. 

**BRE will be backed by the value of energy generated by the Tabbre scheme.**

### Distribution

As Tabbre develops, all profits generated by the scheme will be reinvested into more renewable energy capacity until a target energy output is reached.

At this point, called the **Distribution Point**, profits will be distributed.

The Tabbre decentralized foundation will distribute profits to TABB holders by using the profits to buy and burn TABB.

The intent is to cause significant appreciation in the value of TABB.

BRE is created dynamically on the Tabbre blockchain, in accordance with the Tabbre system's governance rules.

Tabbre is expected to be hugely profitable when it achieves its objective of being the principal global supplier of energy.

### The Global UBI

Tabbre's solar farms are located in international waters that are considered global commons.

In the interests of social fairness and social cohesion and as a protection against confiscation by avaricious and corrupt governments, Tabbre intends to use a significant fraction of profits from the scheme to fund a global universal basic income (UBI).

This will be distributed in BRE.

BRE's role in paying the global UBI coupled with BRE's role as the currency for trading energy will allow BRE to become a non national self-sovereign decentralized global reserve currency.

The Tabbre Project will help transition the world from fossil fuels and establish a global decentralized financial system and in so doing will help end both the climate crisis and global poverty.

### Global Decentralized Financial System


BRE is both the currency for the pricing and sale of energy generated by the Tabbre scheme and the currency for distributing Tabbre'e global UBI.

This will create a substantial and sustainable global economic role for BRE allowing it to become an international decentralized currency to rival fiat currencies.
As such BRE will need to be created in sufficient quantities that it operates as a stable value coin. It is envisaged the value of BRE will be governed by the average price of energy produced by the scheme.

Tabbre's dual coin scheme will be a censor resistant global monetary system that will supplement and compete with the world's existing fiat based banking systems.



## TABB Tokenomics



TABB is a digital gold crypto-currency and as such has a limited issuance, a total of 1,000,000,000 TABB will be created. 250,000,000 will be preminted and 750,000,000 will be minted when new blocks are added on to the TabbreChain. 

The 200,000,000 of the preminted TABB will be sold to investors and 50,000,000 will be held in reserve by the foundation or distributed to founders and partners.

### Usage
As an appreciating asset, the Foundation will use its holdings of TABB as collateral for the sale of fiat denominated bonds. The funds raised from bond sales will be invested in commercially viable schemes that deliver sustainable energy generation, storage and distribution as well as other sustainable technologies. The profits generated from these investments will be reinvested in further commercially viable schemes that deliver sustainable energy generation, storage and distribution.

At some point in the future the Foundation will stop reinvesting profits and instead use its profits to purchase TABB from the open market. 

The Foundation will burn any TABB that it purchases from the open market as well as burning the same amount of TABB from its reserves. Burning TABB in this way will reduce the supply of TABB and so should lead to an increase in the value of the remaining TABB.

### **TABB Allocation** {#tabb-allocation}

A total of one billion TABB will be minted.

The allocation of these TABB coins is set out in the following table:

| Purpose      | Allocation % | Allocation Quantity |
| :----------- | :----------: | ------------------- |
| Private Sale |     20%      | 200,000,000         |
| Public Sale  |     10%      | 100,000,000         |
| Founders     |     10%      | 100,000,000         |
| Reserve      |     60%      | 600,000,000         |
| Total        |     100%     | 1,000,000,000       |

The TABB reserve will be held in a vesting contract with 0.5% being released every month for 120 months.  
TABB released from the reserve may be sold to either provide funds for the development of the Tabbre Project or else used as collateral  for issuing bonds.  
Initially the reserve will be managed by TRL, but will be transferred to TDL once this is operational.

Reserve TABB that has been released from escrow will be deployed in one of the following ways:

* Sold to provide liquidity to the market and to raise funds for use by the Tabbre Project.  
* Held as collateral for the issuance of bonds to raise funds for the Tabbre Project  
* Used as collateral for the issuance of BRE or as collateral for running TabbreChain proof of stake nodes  
* Distributed as payment for services provided by partners to the Tabbre Project  
* Held in reserve for future use  
* Burnt to reduce the potential supply of TABB

### **TABB Staking** {#tabb-staking}

The TabbreChain will initially be operated as a permissioned blockchain, however once the TabbreChain has reached a level of development stability it will be operated using a proof of stake protocol. The asset used for staking will be TABB. Transaction fees will be payable in BRE.

The TabbreChain will be operated by a consortium. Consortium members will be eligible to operate a validator node on the TabbreChain blockchain.  
This will require the member to provide a minimum amount of TABB to be held by the scheme as a stake. This stake will be subject to slashing if the validator node transgresses e.g. by accepting and processing invalid transactions.  
A detailed description of the organization and operation of the TabbreChain is provided elsewhere.

### **TABB Collateral** {#tabb-collateral}

Once the Tabbre Scheme has reached production, BRE will be issued as credit by the BRE Monetary Authority (BMA). This credit will have a low interest rate associated with it. Collateralized Credit Agents (CCA) will use TABB as collateral for borrowing BRE from the BMA. The CCAs will lend the BRE that they borrow from the BMA at a low rate of interest  to retail borrowers, who will pay a higher interest rate. Thus making the lending profitable for the CCAs.

The BMA will be charged with maintaining BRE price stability and will be able to use the credit creation process as a tool to achieve this aim.

### **TABB Buy back**  {#tabb-buy-back}

Once the Tabbre Scheme has reached a target level of energy output, the Tabbre Foundation will use profits from the sale of energy to buy and burn TABB.



## BRE Tokenomics



BRE is an inflationary crypto currency in that its supply, which is controlled algorithmically, is driven by demand. BRE can be created and burned by the Tabbre Foundation to maintain BRE price stability.

The supply of BRE will be managed by the Foundation using clearly formulated and published rules. 

BRE will be created as credit.

### BRE Issuance
BRE will be a stable value coin in that its value will be linked to the value of energy produced by the Tabbre Project.

The principal role of BRE in the Tabbre system is as the currency for the sale of the sustainable renewable energy generated by the Tabbre Foundationâ€™s portfolio of energy projects. Energy produced by the Tabbre Scheme will be priced in BRE and sold to customers in exchange for BRE. These customers will therefore need to have BRE to buy energy. This will create a demand and hence value for BRE.

BRE will also be used to pay Tabbreâ€™s global universal basic income.

Initially, BRE will be created and held by the Tabbre scheme operator for paying suppliers and employees of the Tabbre Project. However, as Tabbre matures the issuance of BRE will be based on the credit creation process described here. 

The BRE Monetary Authority (BMA) will be established. 

The BMA will be responsible for managing the BRE monetary supply, acting in a role analogous to that of a central bank in the fiat currency system. 

The BMA will be constituted as a DAO governed by the holders of TABB via a tokenocracy: One TABB one vote

The BMA will be a decentralized autonomous organization. BRE will be issued by the BRE Monetary Authority, The BMA will manage the supply of BRE using an algorithmic process informed by data provided by oracle services.

In the early stages of the Tabbre Project, it is expected that BRE will be deflationary to support investment inflows. However as the Tabbre Project starts to sell energy priced in BRE, the management of the supply of BRE will be changed to deliver BRE price stability so that BRE becomes a usable means of exchange rather than a deflationary investment asset.

Creating all BRE as credit helps create a shortage of BRE, because there will always be more BRE owing than BRE in existence. This helps underpin the value of BRE.

The BMA will issue BRE denominated loans to intermediaries called Collateralized Credit Agents (CCAs). 

The role of Collateralized Credit Agents will be similar to that of retail banks in the fiat money system in that they will provide retail lending services to consumers and businesses. However it should be noted that unlike the fiat system, where new money is created by retail banks, and bank deposits are owned by the banks and not the account holder, the only party who can create new BRE is the Tabbre Foundation and all BRE will be held on chain in wallets controlled by the owners of that BRE.

By using the centralized credit creation model the BRE Monetary Authority will be able to set interest rates and control the money supply to maintain the target value of BRE. 

The CCAs will be required to pledge TABB as collateral for the BRE that they receive. This will help ensure that the CCAs lend responsibly. This will also act to reduce TABB liquidity helping to underpin the value of TABB.













+++++++++++

BRE will be issued by the BRE Monetary Authority, BMA. This will be a decentralized autonomous organization and will manage the supply of BRE using an algorithmic process informed by data provided by oracle services.

The BMA will be hosted on the TabbreChain. This blockchain will be secured using a proof of stake (PoS) consensus model. 

The TabbreChain will be operated by a consortium. Consortium members will be eligible to operate a validator node on the TabbreChain blockchain.
This will require the member to provide a minimum amount of TABB to be held by the scheme as a stake. This stake will be subject to slashing if the validator node transgresses e.g. by accepting and processing invalid transactions.
A detailed description of the organization and operation of the TabbreChain is provided elsewhere.

Transaction charges will be applied to transactions submitted to the TabbreChain. These transaction charges will be denominated and payable in the BRE. BRE will be the TabbreChainâ€™s native transactional currency.

New  BRE coins will be minted onto the TabbreChain by the BMA. These newly minted BRE may be lent by the BMA to entities called collateralized credit agents, CCAs.

CCAâ€™s will provide TABB as collateral to the BMA as a pre-requisite for borrowing BRE.
In the event of a CCA not repaying a BRE loan to the BMA, or failing to comply with the loan agreement in some other way,  the BMA will take the TABB collateral as full and final payment of the loan.Depending on the circumstances,TABB acquired in this way will either be vested, auctioned off or burnt. Whichever is most appropriate for ensuring stability of the TABB/BRE financial system.


The rate of interest charged by the BMA will act as the BRE economies base rate of interest, the BRE Base Rate (BBR).

The CCAâ€™s will lend their borrowed BRE to retail customers including, inter alia: businesses, NGOs, consumers, state owned entities and local authorities. The interest rate charged by CCAs on their lending to the retail customers will be higher than the BBR. This provides the income for the CCAs. This could be considerable.

If a BRE CCA fails to repay a BRE loan, theTABB collateral will be retained by the BRE Issuer. Depending on the circumstances,TABB acquired in this way will either be vested, auctioned off or burnt. Whichever is most appropriate for ensuring stability of the TABB/BRE financial system.

### BRE and Energy


Tabbre intends to sell the energy that it produces for BRE. In the early stages of the Tabbre scheme, this may be problematic for the commercial entities that will be buying the energy. They may have an aversion, either because of regulation or cultural inertia to use BRE on the basis that it is not a recognized fiat currency. To overcome this problem the Tabbre scheme will create intermediaries, Energy Sales Agents (Agents). These Agents
## Distribution of profits
After the Distribution Point is reached, the schemeâ€™s profits will be used to buy TABB in the open market. TABB bought in this way will be burnt thus creating a demand for TABB while reducing the supply of TABB.

The Tabbre DAO will be given the responsibility for the allocation of the schemeâ€™s profits. It is envisaged that profits will be allocated to the following categories:

- Research and Development
- New Investment
- Investor Returns
- Global UBI

The Tabbre Treasury will be responsible for the distribution of profits. 

The Tabbre Treasury will be directed by the Tabbre DAO. 

The exact nature and modus operandi of the DAO is a subject of research.

## Global Universal Basic Income (GUBI)

The Tabbre Project has identified a major risk to the long term success of the Tabbre Project.

Using some of the profits generated
